## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aman302002/Notes_Keeper.git
cd Notes_Keeper  

# You need to open two terminals, one for the frontend and one for the backend

# For running server 
cd keeper-app-server
npm start 

# For running react-app
cd keeper-app-ui
npm i
npm start


After this react-app will automatically open in your browser on address localhost:3000
Your server is on the address localhost:4000
